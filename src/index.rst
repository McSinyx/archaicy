Overview
========

Pythonic Audio Library and Codecs Environment provides common higher-level API
for audio rendering using OpenAL.  It wraps around the C++ interface alure_
for 3D positional rendering, environmental effects and out-of-the-box
codec support, while using Cython to provide a modern interface with
type hinting, data descriptors, context managers and ``snake_case``
for a safe, convenient and pleasurable experience.
