Source manipulation
===================

We have created a source in the last section.
As said previously, its properties can be manipulated
to create wanted effects.

Moving the source
-----------------

Changing :py:meth:`Source.position` is one of the most noticeable,
but first, we have to enable spatialization via :py:attr:`Source.spatialize`.
